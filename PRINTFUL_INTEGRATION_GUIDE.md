- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (preferred)
- **Color Mode**: RGB for digital printing
- **Size**: Follow Printful's templates for each product

### Design Guidelines for Steampunk Theme:
1. **T-Shirts/Apparel**: 
   - Design area: 12" x 16" (standard)
   - Keep important elements 1" from edges
   
2. **Mugs**:
   - Wrap design: 9.5" x 4"
   - Single side: 3" x 3"
   
3. **Posters/Prints**:
   - Add 0.25" bleed for edge-to-edge prints
   - Ensure text is readable at print size

## 🛠️ Step 4: Product Setup in Printful

### For Each Product:

1. **In Printful Dashboard:**
   ```
   Product Catalog > Choose Product Type > Select Specific Product
   ```

2. **Upload Design:**
   - Use Printful's design tool
   - Position artwork correctly
   - Preview on all colors/sizes

3. **Configure Variants:**
   - Select available sizes (S, M, L, XL, 2XL, etc.)
   - Choose colors that complement your steampunk designs
   - Recommended: Black, Navy, Charcoal, Natural

4. **Set Retail Prices:**
   ```
   Suggested Pricing Formula:
   Retail Price = (Printful Base Cost × 2.5) + $2
   
   Example:
   T-shirt base cost: $12.95
   Your retail price: ($12.95 × 2.5) + $2 = $34.38 → Round to $34.99
   ```

5. **Product Descriptions:**
   - Include size chart information
   - Mention print method (DTG, embroidery, etc.)
   - Add care instructions
   - Highlight eco-friendly options

## 📊 Step 5: Sync with Shopify

1. **Push Products to Shopify:**
   - In Printful: Products > Select items > "Push to Shopify"
   - Choose which details to sync (recommended: all)

2. **What Gets Synced:**
   - Product title and description
   - All variants (size/color combinations)
   - Pricing
   - Product images and mockups

3. **After Sync:**

## 🚚 Step 6: Shipping Configuration

2. **Enable Printful Live Shipping Rates:**
   ```
   Settings > Shipping > Manage rates > Add rate

## 💰 Step 7: Profit Optimization

### Pricing Strategy:

   - Shipping (if not passed to customer)
   - Shopify transaction fees (2.9% + 30¢)
   - Marketing costs

2. **Recommended margins:**
   - Apparel: 40-50% markup

   - Home decor: 45-55% markup

3. **Bundle opportunities:**

   - Seasonal collections

## 📈 Step 8: Order Management

### Automatic Order Flow:
1. Customer places order on Shopify
2. Order automatically sent to Printful
3. Printful produces item
4. Printful ships directly to customer
5. Tracking info sent to customer

### Manual Checks:
- Review orders in Printful dashboard daily
- Monitor failed orders (usually payment/address issues)
- Handle customer service for quality issues

## 🎨 Step 9: Product Page Optimization

### Add to Product Templates:

```liquid
<!-- Size Chart Section -->
{% render 'size-chart', product: product %}

<!-- Production Time Notice -->
<div class="production-notice">
  <p>📦 Made-to-order item. Production time: 2-7 business days.</p>
</div>

<!-- Care Instructions -->
<div class="care-instructions">
  <h4>Care Instructions:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Machine wash cold, inside-out</li>
    <li>Tumble dry low</li>
    <li>Do not iron decoration</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```
